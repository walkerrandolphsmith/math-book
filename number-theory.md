##Division
If m and n are integers where m $$\not =$$ 0,m divides n if there is an integer k such that $$n = mk $$

$$ m \mid\ n$$ Equivalently $$\frac{n}{m}$$ is an integer

If m divides n, m is a factor of n and n is a multiple of m 


##Divisibilty of Integers
If a $$\mid$$ b and a $$\mid$$ c then a $$\mid$$ (b+c)

If a $$\mid$$ b, then a $$\mid$$ bc for all integers c

If a $$\mid$$ c and b $$\mid$$ c, then a $$\mid$$ c




##Coprime
Integers m and n are relatively prime if 
$$
\gcd (m,n) = 1
$$

##Euler's Theorm
If n and m are relatively prime for some m,n $$\in$$ $$\mathbb{Z}^+$$

$$
n^{\Phi(m)}\equiv 1\mod{m}
$$

$$
n^{\Phi(m)} - 1\equiv 0\mod{m}
$$
