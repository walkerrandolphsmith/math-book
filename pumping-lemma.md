 #Pumping Lemma
 
 The pumping lemma is a property held by regular sets.
 
 If a set is a regular it has pumping property and if there is an abscence of the pumping property then it is not a regular set. This relationship is captured with the following logic:
 
 $$
\mbox{p} \rightarrow \mbox{q} \equiv \neg \mbox{q} \rightarrow \neg \mbox{p}
$$

If L is a regular set
